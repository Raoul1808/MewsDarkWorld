# Mew's Dark World mod
 Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Mew's Dark World mod!

 This mod was specifically made for me to get used to modding with tModLoader before attacking another mod project. This *may* end up being a full mod. We never know.
 Contributions are welcome.

## Building the mod
 I'll add this section just for anyone willing to contribute or clone this mod for their own purposes.

 1. Get Terraria and tModLoader.
 2. Get Visual Studio (in this case, version 2019)
   - Make sure you have the .NET Desktop Development package installed
   - Also make sure you have both XNA and .NET Framework 4.5+ on your system (if you have installed Terraria and ran it at least once, those are already installed)
 3. Clone this repository (preferably in `Documents/My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/Mod Sources`)
 4. Enjoy!

## Roadmap?
 [ ] Nothing, for now...
